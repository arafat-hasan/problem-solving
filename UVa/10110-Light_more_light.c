/*
* There are a few things you should immediately notice:
*
*	1. Once Mabu has done his nth walk, the nth switch is never toggled again.
*	2. The answer is yes iff the nth switch is toggled an odd number of times
*		(otherwise, for each time it is turned on, it gets turned off, and is
*		thus off in the end).
*	3. The nth switch is toggled once for each factor of n.
*
* With this in mind, how can we tell if a number has an even or odd number of factors?
* For every factor n has below sqrt(n) it has one above sqrt(n). This suggests that
* unless n is a perfect square, it has an even number of factors. So, the problem
* boils down to deciding if n is a perfect square or not. Use your favorite math
* libraries to find the answer.
